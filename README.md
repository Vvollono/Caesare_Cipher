# Description of the project 
Create a program that encode and decode an encripted message

#Breakingdown project

1) Create a function called 'encript' that takes the text and 'shift' as inputs

2) Inside the 'encrypt' function, shift each letter of the 'text' forwards in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the encrypted text.  
    e.g. 
    plain_text = "hello"
    shift = 5
    cipher_text = "mjqqt"
    print output: "The encoded text is mjqqt"
	
3) Call the encrypt function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message.
